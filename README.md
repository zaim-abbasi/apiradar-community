## 🛠️ How to Contribute
You can help shape APIRadar even without access to the core code:

### 1. Request a Feature
Want us to scan a new provider like Stripe, AWS, or Twilio?
* Go to **[Discussions → Ideas](https://github.com/zaim-abbasi/apiradar-community/discussions/categories/ideas)**.
* Start a thread with the provider name and an example key format.

### 2. Report a Bug

* Open an **[Issue](https://github.com/zaim-abbasi/apiradar-community/issues)**.
* Include your browser version and a screenshot if you can.

## 🔒 Security Policy
APIRadar is built to **detect** leaks, not exploit them.
* We partially redact all API keys in our database for safety.
* If you find a security vulnerability in APIRadar itself, please contact me privately through my GitHub profile instead of opening a public issue.
