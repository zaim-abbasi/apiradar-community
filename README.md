## 👋 Welcome to the Lab
This repository serves as the public community hub for **[APIRadar](https://apiradar.live)**. 

Since the core scanning engine contains proprietary verification logic to prevent abuse, the source code is currently private. However, we believe in building with the community. This repo is where we collaborate on the roadmap.

## 🚀 Quick Links
* **🔴 Live Dashboard:** [apiradar.live](https://apiradar.live)
* **💬 Community & Support:** [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/zaim-abbasi/apiradar-community/discussions)
* **🐛 Bug Tracker:** [Issues](https://github.com/zaim-abbasi/apiradar-community/issues)

## 🛠️ How to Contribute
Even without the core code, you can shape the future of APIRadar:

### 1. Request a Feature
Want us to scan a new provider (e.g., Stripe, AWS, Twilio)?
* Go to **[Discussions → Ideas](https://github.com/zaim-abbasi/apiradar-community/discussions/categories/ideas)**
* Start a thread with the provider name and example key format.

### 2. Report a Bug
Found a false positive or a UI glitch?
* Open a new **[Issue](https://github.com/zaim-abbasi/apiradar-community/issues)**.
* Please include the browser version and a screenshot if possible.

## 🔒 Security Policy
APIRadar is designed to **detect** leaks, not exploit them.
* We do not store the full API keys in our database (keys are partially redacted).
* If you find a security vulnerability within the APIRadar platform itself, please email me directly instead of posting a public issue.
